<h3>Island of lost Souls  (1932)</h3>
    <p>A very classic horror movie about a sailor who becomes stranded on an island
        where a mad scientist, Dr. Monreau is creating monstrous hybrids of man 
        and beast. It's a really old movie with a lot of really 
        dramatic shots, which make it hilarious. </p>

<h3>28 days Later (2002)</h3>
    <p>
        A gritty and frantic story of survival as a man wakes from a coma, finding himself in an apocalyptic world
        swarming with those infected with the rage virus. In an attempt to find sanctuary, he must venture
        across the British countryside, banding together with other survivors along the way.
